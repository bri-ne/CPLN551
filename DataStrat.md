# Data Strategy Ideas

## Agregate by peak times (bri)
- rush hour 
- google for general peak times 
- look in the data

## Get geometries (marlana)
- sql or arcgis
- asking Mjumbe for advice on this and in general about our idea

## ask eugene 
- about using data that are averages instead of counts?
  - what does it mean to have a sum of averages?
  - should we just be taking the ave of the aves??
  - how do we compare it to data that is based on counts?---spatially

## email josh
- data dict
- time units
